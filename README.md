This project contains R code to generate visualisations from the World Happiness Report dataset. It is a precursor to the final presentation.

## Configuration

To set up this project:

1.  Clone the repository

2.  Open it in RStudio, or similar.

3.  Run `renv::restore()` to restore the complete set of package dependencies used in the project to your local environment

4.  Drop a copy of the source files into the `source_data` directory. The scripts will fail without this step.

5.  Run, or knit, the file `group_presentation_data_analysis.Rmd` to see the visualisations.
